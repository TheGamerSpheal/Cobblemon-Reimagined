Cobblemon Reimagined (WIP)

This is Minecraft Cobblemon datapack that aims to breathe some new life into old pokémon, by giving them new typings, abilities, stat spreads and moves. Most inspiration is taken from the Luminescent Platinum
Mod made by the Luminescent Team and the Radical Red ROM Hack made by Eric "Soupacell" Huang.

Any suggestions are welcome

NEXT OBJECTIVES
- Full list of changes made to every Pokémon
- Advancements for catching every Pokémon (one for each Pokémon, not guaranteed to actually be made)
- Put it on Modrinth and the Cobblemon Discord
